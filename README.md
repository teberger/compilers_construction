Compilers Construction
======================

Work for the Compiler Construction course at UNM during Fall 2014 (CS 554)

Topics and subfolders include:
 * warmup1: an emulator for a simple hardware component. The spec is included
    * The first attempt was written in haskell, but I found it lacking when dealing with a machine state. The State Monad helps, but it feels a bit cumbersome which might be a symptom of my lack of expertise with Haskell.
